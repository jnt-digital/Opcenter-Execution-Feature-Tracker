# Opcenter Execution Feature Tracker

A comprehensive repository tracking feature releases across the Opcenter Execution product suite by version.

## üéØ Overview

Keeping track of what features were introduced in which version across Opcenter Execution's multiple products can be challenging. This repository provides a centralized feature timeline, making it easy to:

- **Track feature evolution** across product versions
- **Plan upgrades** by understanding what's available in each release
- **Compare features** between Core, Electronics, and Semiconductor suit

### Legend
| Code | Product | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **CR** | Opcenter Execution Core | Base platform and core functionality |
| **EL** | Opcenter Execution Electronics | Electronics manufacturing features |
| **SM** | Opcenter Execution Semiconductor | Semiconductor manufacturing features |

## üìä Usage Examples

### Planning an Upgrade
1. Identify your current version
2. Review features in target versions
3. Assess impact on your specific product mix (CR/EL/SM)

### Training Preparation
1. Review new features by version
2. Focus on your deployed products
3. Plan training based on feature complexity
